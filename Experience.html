  <p><font size="+2"color="black"FACE="Berlin Sans FB"> My first career experience is that I used to sell food in the school canteen. I started working as a food seller at the school canteen during my semester holiday. When I was working in the school canteen, my job was not just to sell, I was also being told to clean the canteen after school and help the cookers who were cooking in the kitchen. I really love my job because this job really teach me on how to be a discipline person. I need to wake up early in the morning, take a bath and ride my motorcycle in order to get myself at the canteen before 7 a.m. Next, what I really like about this job are I also can get a free lunch and of course all of the dishes was so delicious and scrumptious. During my experience as a food seller at this canteen, i really show a good attitude toward all of my employee and my manager.

</body>
</html>
<p><font size="+2"color="white"FACE="Berlin Sans FB"> My second experience is during my semester 5 in my diploma, my friend and I have join a catering from my university cafe. My salary is RM 80 per day which I consider it as worth because the working time is from 7 a.m. until 5 p.m. As a student, I think that the paid was reasonable and affordable which I can use it as my money to buy food for about 8 to 10 days I think. For me, working as a caterer was a job that require a lot of energy because there are a lot of thing that need to be done in a short time such as lifting heaving things, preparing equipment such as dishes, cups, and many more. We also need to wrap up first the food that has been cooked before we bring it to the wedding ceremony.   Though this job is very tiring and requires a lot of physical abilities, I want to take this experience as one of the best and meaningful experience in my life and I will never forget this moment forever.
