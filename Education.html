<p><font size="+2"color="black"FACE="Berlin Sans FB"> My first education is at Kindergarten. I started to go to kindergarten when my age is 6 years old. The location of the kindergarten is just a stone throw away from my house. I usually prefer to walk or cycle my bicycle to go there. There are a lot of things that I learn there such as how to memorize alphabets and numbers, how to solve math problem using a sempoa and I also learn mandarin language there. I am very happy to study there because despite having a good friends, I also get a sporting and kind teacher to teach me until I understand and doing well in the subject.

<p><font size="+2"color="black"FACE="Berlin Sans FB"> My second education for sure is at my primary school. I start my primary school at Sekolah Kebangsaan Bertam Indah started from 2007 until 2011. During my primary school there are lots of memories that I create. There are many good memories but for sure there will be also bad memories, but for me it doesnâ€™t matter because all of the memories will become experience and for me experience is our best teacher right? The best thing that happen at me during my primary school was I get 5A in UPSR and my school get the first ranking at Pulau Pinang. For bad memories, actually there are many things that happen such as fight with my friend, scold by teacher for being late, misunderstanding with my best friend, and many more. But all that I can say is I love my primary school so much.

<p><font size="+2"color="black"FACE="Berlin Sans FB"> Next, my third education is when I further my study at Sekolah Menengah Kebangsaan Agama Al Irshad started from 2012 until 2016. During my 5 years at my secondary school, I decide to stay at hostel. This is because, when I stay at hostel, I can learn on how to manage time properly and learn to be independent. There are lot of activities that I join in my secondary school such as I participate in Football Match, Track and Field Competition, and many more. In my PT3 examination, I only manage to get 5A and with that result, I continue my study in higher form by taking account course and for my SPM, I only manage to ge 4A. Actually, I am little bit disappointed with myself because I do not achieve my goal, so I decide that I want to do my best during my study in the university. This is it. This school, this vibe and environment really teach me a lot of things. Even though you did not get what you want, you must always think positive and if you fall seven times, you must stand up eight. There are nobody can't change your future except yourself.

<p><font size="+2"color="black"FACE="Berlin Sans FB"> After SPM, Alhamdulillah I get an offer letter from UITM in Diploma Of Business Management. Honestly, when I get this offer, I did not feel anything, sad or happy. Maybe I still cannot move on with my SPM result and still did not ready to continue my journey as a student. After thinking and discussing with my parent, I decide to go there and finish my diploma there for about 2 years and a half. Actually, I think the best part of my experience as student is here. I meet a lot of friend from other state. I learn how to communicate with different slang and I found that it is very interesting. During my time at UITM, my classmate was very sporting, supportive and always helps me if I need any help. They are like my second family here. I love this UITM so much and I also study very well here. During my 5 Semester, I get 3 Dean List and for me that was one of the best moment in my student's life. The last day I spent at UITM really make me heart breaking. This is because I know that that is the last time I will meet and spent time with them. I hope that everyone are doing well in their life and always remember me. Thank you for all memories, until we meet again next time.
